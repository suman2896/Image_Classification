# Image Classification Streamlit Web App
This project showcases an advanced image classification system by leveraging the power of two distinct machine learning models: a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed specifically for the CIFAR-10 dataset and the highly efficient pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. Each model brings unique strengths to the table, offering users the opportunity to explore and compare the capabilities of a tailored architecture versus a widely used transfer learning approach.
